Hi! I am a third-year graduate student in computer science at [Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ict.cas.cn/), supervised by [Xiaoming Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WKpSlhQAAAAJ) and [Jialin Zhang](https://dblp.org/pid/91/2798-1.html). I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science and quantum computation. Recently, I am working on quantum cryptography and distributed quantum computing.

Coding
=====
I am one of the core contributors to the open-source SDK <a href="https://quict-docs.readthedocs.io/aa/latest/" style="background-color: #5488e8; display: inline-block; padding: 2px;"><img src="images/quict_logo_white.webp" alt="QuICT Logo" style="vertical-align: middle; border: none; width: 80px;"> </a> for quantum computation, which is analogous to Qiskit but specialized in quantum circuit compiling. 

Besides, I participated in *International Collegiate Programming
Contest (ICPC)* back when I was an undergrad. We won
<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://board.xcpcio.com/icpc/2020/jinan"><span style="background-color:#fff566;color: #494e52;">Gold Medal</span></a> at ICPC Asia Regional (Jinan) and 
<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://board.xcpcio.com/icpc/2020/jinan"><span style="background-color:#ffadd2;color: #494e52;">Silver Medal</span></a> at ICPC Asia East-Continent Final. 
My max Codeforces rating is <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://codeforces.com/profile/Cothrax"><span style="color: purple;">**2083**</span></a>.


Others
=====
I play piano. My (current) favorite composer is [Nikolai Kapustin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kapustin).
