I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Tom Gur](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/tg508). My research focuses on the interplay between quantum computation and theoretical computer science, with interests spanning quantum cryptography, distributed quantum computing, and quantum circuits.

Prior to my PhD, I completed my Master’s degree at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I was advised by [Xiaoming Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WKpSlhQAAAAJ) and [Jialin Zhang](https://dblp.org/pid/91/2798-1.html). I received my Bachelor’s degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.
